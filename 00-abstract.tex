JavaScript evolves to a general purpose language. Simultaneously, the complexity of its applications is rising, demanding for even more computational resources that can no longer be satisfied by a single-threaded runtime-system. However, the JavaScript community has not widely employed multithreading. Simply because the available standards are platform-dependent and enforce a messaging-based programming model that does not integrate seamlessly into existing applications. This paper presents \textit{Parallel.es}, a platform-independent, type-safe API and runtime system simplifying the creation of multithreaded applications in JavaScript by abstracting the messaging-based programming model. Parallel tasks are defined by normal JavaScript functions and are executed concurrently in background threads. The runtime system further offers a reactive API simplifying the parallelization of data-stream-based operations by facilitating automated work partitioning and result joining. The evaluation shows that the runtime system performs well compared to related work. Nevertheless, the proposed system mainly shines because of its seamless integration into existing code bases and the type-safety of its API. Moreover, the same debugging experience as for synchronous code can be provided if the presented transpiler is used that creates source maps for parallel tasks pointing back to the original code.
