JavaScript evolves to a general-purpose language. Simultaneously, the complexity of its applications is rising, demanding for even more computational resources that can no longer be satisfied by a single-threaded runtime system. However, the JavaScript community has not widely employed multithreading because the available standards are platform-dependent and enforce a messaging-based programming model. This paper presents \textit{Parallel.es}, a platform-independent type-safe API and runtime system allowing to create multithreaded applications in JavaScript with ease. It abstracts the messaging-based programming model for a seamless integration into existing program code and allows to use standard JavaScript functions to define tasks executing concurrently in background threads. Moreover, the reactive API of the runtime system simplifies the parallelization of data-stream-based operations by facilitating automated work partitioning and result joining. The evaluation shows that the runtime system performs well compared to related work. Nevertheless, the proposed system is mainly superior because of its seamless integration into existing code and the type-safety of its API.
