\section{Related Work}\label{sec:related-work}
There exist various open source projects addressing similar or equal goals. This section describes the differences of the presented work to the already existing ones. One main difference of the presented system to the related work is that it offers the same debugging functionalities as developers are used to when working with synchronous code.

\subsection{Hamsters.js}
Hamsters.js~\cite{hamstersjs} is the library with the highest attention measured by the number of GitHub stars. It provides a low-level API for running functions in a background thread and uses a global thread pool to manage the created background threads. It supports transferable objects and provides various helper functionalities like array sorting, aggregating, or caching.

The main difference to Hamsters.js is that the API of the proposed work is type-safe and integrates seamlessly into existing program code. Hamsters.js further has the limitation that functionalities of external libraries can not be exposed in the background threads.

\subsection{Parallel.js}
Parallel.js~\cite{SavitzkyMayr2016} has been initiated in 2013 and is the oldest of the evaluated libraries. Its main goal is to provide a simple API for multiprocessing in JavaScript. It provides a uniform API for the browser and NodeJS --- web workers are used in the browser, child processes~\cite{childProcess} on NodeJS. Parallel.js provides a low-level API for running a function in a background thread and a reactive API providing automatic work partitioning and result joining. 

Parallel.js differs in two points from the presented work. Firstly, it does not use a thread pool and therefore can not reuse background threads across operations (e.g. map or filter). Secondly, it awaits the sub-results of the proceeding operation before continuing with the next operation if multiple operations are chained together, e.g. the reduce step summing up the values of a filtered array waits until all background threads have completed filtering before starting with summing up the values. Moreover, the sub-results are transmitted back to the main thread before starting the next operation on new background threads. This results in unneeded --- and potentially very expensive --- copying of intermediate results from and to background threads.


The latest published version on npm\footnote{NPM is a package manager for JavaScript. The latest published version of Parallel.js to date is 0.2.1.} spawns a new background thread for every element in the input array exhausting the thread limit of the browser. The most recent version on GitHub has corrected this behavior by limiting the number of spawned workers. Therefore, when Parallel.js is referenced, the latest version\footnote{Commit 2e4b36bf16e330abaaff213e772fcf4074fd866b} from GitHub is meant.

\subsection{Threads.js}
Thread.js~\cite{Wermke2016} aims to be a simple to use and powerful multithreading library for NodeJS and the browser. It uses child processes when running in NodeJS and web workers when running in the browser.

The main difference of Threads.js is its messaging-based programming model that is nearer to the programming model used by the underlying technologies. Therefore, bridging the programming model gap is left to the programmer.
