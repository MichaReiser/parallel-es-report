\section{Evaluation}\label{sec:evaluation}
The evaluation focuses on computations that are expected to profit from parallelization, e.g. compute-intensive tasks or tasks over a large set of data. However, using the presented runtime system may also be beneficial for long-running, but not parallelized computations that otherwise would block the main thread and result in a degraded user experience. The evaluation compares the presented work with the alternatives introduced in \cref{sec:related-work} concerning applicability and performance using the following set of problems:

\begin{itemize}
	\item[$\bullet$] Knight Tour: Computes the number of open tours from a given start field. This problem has  low memory but very high computational needs.
	\item[$\bullet$] Mandelbrot $10'000 \times 10'000$: Computation of a Mandelbrot for a given image size. This problem requires a large amount of memory compared to the computational time needed.
	\item[$\bullet$] Risk Profiling: The risk profiling uses a Monte Carlo simulation to create forecasts for the customer's asset development over a period of 15 years for various investment strategies. The forecast is used to illustrate how a chosen investment strategy affects the development of the customer's assets and therefore, planned investments --- e.g. buying a house after ten years. This problem is an instance of a real-world problem~\cite{Kwsoft2016}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Applicability}
The applicability is assessed by comparing the Mandelbrot implementations. The reference implementation for the evaluation is the sequential, lodash~\cite{lodash} based implementation of the Mandelbrot that has been introduced in \cref{sec:programming-model} and is shown in \cref{fig:mandelbrot-sync}. The implementations for the specific runtime systems highlight the differences to the reference implementations in gray. The implementations omit the computation of a single pixel for brevity. The preliminary focus of the evaluation is how seamless background tasks integrate into existing code and the type-safety of the API. Some of the results might be subjective and represent the opinion of the author. 

\paragraph{Parallel.es}
The Parallel.es based implementation of the Mandelbrot from \cref{sec:programming-model} and shown in  \cref{code:mandelbrot-parallel.es} is almost identical to the sequential implementation. The implementation does not require any adjustment to the \javascriptinline/computePixel/ and \javascriptinline/computeMandelbrotLine/ functions because the task function can reference read-only variables and functions from its outer scope allowing a seamless integration of background task into existing applications. However, this liberty comes at the cost of requiring a potentially additional build step to transpile the program code. It is reasonable to assume that the benefits of a seamless integration outweigh the additional complexity in the build process. Especially because transpiling of source code --- mostly using Babel~\cite{babel} --- is very common in the JavaScript community. 

\paragraph{Parallel.js}
\Cref{fig:mandelbrot-paralleljs} shows the Mandelbrot implementation using the reactive API of Parallel.js. It differs only slightly from the sequential implementation. A background task is created using the \javascriptinline/Parallel/ constructor (line \ref{code:paralleljs-definition}). The first constructor argument is the data to process, the second --- optional --- argument is an options object affecting the task execution. The value of the options object's \javascriptinline/env/ property is exposed as \javascriptinline/global.env/ in the background thread (line \ref{code:paralleljs-global}). The task function passed to the \javascriptinline/map/ operation (line \ref{code:paralleljs-map}) is called for every element in the input array and produces the elements in the output array.

\begin{listing}
	\begin{javascriptcode*}{highlightlines={9, 22-29}}
const imageWidth = 10000;
const imageHeight = 10000;

function computePixel(x, y) {
	// ...
	return n;
}

function computeMandelbrotLine(y, imageWidth) {
	const arraySize = imageWidth * 4;
	const line = new Uint8ClampedArray(arraySize);
	
	for (let x = 0; x < imageWidth; ++x) {
		line[x * 4] = computePixel(x, y);
	}
	
	return line;
}

const lines = _.range(imageHeight);

new Parallel(lines, { env: { imageWidth } }) |$\label{code:paralleljs-definition}$|
	.require(computeMandelbrotLine) |$\label{code:paralleljs-require}$|
	.require(computePixel)
	.map(function (line) { |$\label{code:paralleljs-map}$|
		const width = global.env.imageWidth;|$\label{code:paralleljs-global}$|
		return computeMandelbrotLine(line, width));
	})
	.then(result => console.log(result));
\end{javascriptcode*}

\end{listing}

Functions called from inside of a task function have to be made explicitly available in the background thread by using the \javascriptinline/require/ method (line \ref{code:paralleljs-require}). Additionally, the variable \javascriptinline/imageWidth/ can not be referenced by the task function (and the \javascriptinline/computeMandelbrot/ function). Instead, the value needs to be explicitly passed to the background thread by storing it in the \javascriptinline/env/ property of the options object (line \ref{code:paralleljs-definition}) and retrieving it in the task function by using \javascriptinline/global.env/ (line \ref{code:paralleljs-global}).


The use of the undeclared variable \javascriptinline/global/ (line \ref{code:paralleljs-global}) to expose additional data in the task function is problematic since it breaks static scoping and requires additional care in typed languages. Typed languages require the variable \javascriptinline/global/ to be declared. It can either be declared in every module it is used or globally in a declaration file. In both cases, no specific type can be annotated for the environment property since its type depends upon the actual problem. Therefore, type checking needs to be disabled for the environment property by annotating a special opt-out type like \javascriptinline/any/ in TypeScript~\cite{typescript}. However, declaring the \javascriptinline/global/ variable has the undesired side effect that the type checker no longer detects illegal usages of it outside of a task function in which case the variable is truly undeclared. The \javascriptinline/global/ variable also hinders code reuse because it is undeclared if a task function is called from the main thread.

The implementation of the risk profiling problem in Parallel.js requires some tricks to be performant. The issue is that Parallel.js provides no mean to store the Monte Carlo simulation results across the invocations of the task function other than saving it in the global context of the background thread. Storing the simulation result in the global context is unaesthetic but can not introduce memory leaks since Parallel.js terminates the background threads when the operation has completed. However, an explicit API from Parallel.js would be favored that also remains functional if Parallel.js is using thread pools in the future.

To sum up, the API has the disadvantage not to be type-safe and does not allow to store data across task function invocations. Furthermore, variables and functions used in a task function need to be explicitly made available to the background thread, resulting in a clear break in the programming style. If this break can be accepted and type-safety is not a concern, then Parallel.js is a good choice as it allows to include additional functions in a task without the need for static code transpilation by using the \javascriptinline/require/ function (line \ref{code:paralleljs-require}).

\paragraph{Threads.js}
\Cref{fig:mandelbrot-threadsjs} shows the Threads.js based Mandelbrot implementation. Threads.js can be used with or without thread pools. A thread pool needs to be created manually if one is desired (line \ref{code:threadsjs-pool}). The task function is specified by using the \javascriptinline/pool.run/ method (line \ref{code:threadsjs-worker}). A new task for this function is created by invoking the \javascriptinline/send/ method (line \ref{code:threadsjs-messaging}) where the passed arguments are used to invoke the task function in the background thread. The result of a single task can be retrieved by registering a \javascriptinline/done/ handler (line \ref{code:threadsjs-task-completion}) that in this example is used to join the sub-results of the tasks manually. The thread pool offers the \javascriptinline/finished/ event (line \ref{code:threadsjs-done}) that is triggered when all tasks of this pool have completed\footnote{The finished event cannot be used to determine the completion of an operation consisting of multiple tasks if tasks of other operations are executed on the same thread pool.}.

\begin{listing}
	\begin{javascriptcode*}{highlightlines={5, 17, 20-21, 27-28, 31}}
const imageWidth = 10000;
const imageHeight = 10000;

function computeMandelbrotLine({ y, width}, done) {
	function computePixel(x, y) {|$\label{code:threadsjs-compute-pixel}$|
		// ...
		return n;
	}
	
	const arraySize = width * 4;
	const line = new Uint8ClampedArray(arraySize);

	for (let x = 0; x < width; ++x) {
		line[x * 4] = computePixel(x, y);
	}

	done.transfer(line, [line.buffer]);
}

const pool = new Pool(); |$\label{code:threadsjs-pool}$|
pool.run(computeMandelbrotLine); |$\label{code:threadsjs-worker}$|

const lines = _.range(imageHeight);
const result = new Array(imageHeight);
for (const y of lines) {
	pool
		.send({ y, imageWidth }) |$\label{code:threadsjs-messaging}$|
		.on("done", line => result[y] = line);|$\label{code:threadsjs-task-completion}$|
}

pool.on("finished", () => console.log(result)); |$\label{code:threadsjs-done}$|
\end{javascriptcode*}

\end{listing}


The Threads.js API offers a clean, flexible, messaging-based API to run single tasks in background threads but does not provide a higher-level abstraction for common operations. This lack of a higher-level API complicates the migration of existing code since the programmer needs to partition the work into different tasks, join the sub-results, and is responsible for managing the lifetime of the thread pool. Neither provides the API a mechanism to expose a function from the same module to a task function. Therefore, the \javascriptinline/computePixel/ function (line \ref{code:threadsjs-compute-pixel}) has to be nested inside of the \javascriptinline/computeMandelbrotLine/ function. This missing mechanism restricts the programmer in his options to structure the code. Alike Parallel.js, the API of Threads.js is not type-safe since \javascriptinline/run/ does not return a new thread pool instance; it instead changes the task function of the existing instance. A new instance is required to reflect the relation between the task function's parameters, specified using the \javascriptinline/run/ method, and the arguments passed to \javascriptinline/send/, that are used to invoke the task function, in the thread pools type signature.

The implementation of the risk profiling problem in Threads.js requires storing the Monte Carlo simulation results in the global context of the background thread to be performant for the same reason as for Parallel.js. However, this misuse of the global context introduces memory leaks if a shared thread pool is used. It would, therefore, be preferred to have an explicit API provided by Threads.js to store data across task function invocations.

To sum up. The API of Threads.js is simple in use but commonly used features like the joining of the sub-results are missing. The messaging-based programming model results in a clear break in the programming style. Moreover, Threads.js is a nonideal choice for projects using typed language since the API is not type-safe.

\paragraph{Hamsters.js}
\Cref{fig:mandelbrot-hamsterjs} shows the Mandelbrot implementation using Hamsters.js. A task is started using the \javascriptinline/hamsters.run/ method (line \ref{code:hamsterjs-start}). The passed arguments have the following semantic:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item An object that is passed to the task function. The special property \javascriptinline/array/ defines the input data. The object is exposed by the \javascriptinline/params/ variable (line \ref{code:hamstersjs-params} and \ref{code:hamstersjs-params-two}) in the task function.
	\item The task function to execute in a background thread.
	\item The callback function that is invoked when the operation has completed.
	\item The number of tasks to create at most --- into how many tasks should the input array be partitioned. 
	\item Defines if the sub-results of the tasks are automatically joined (\javascriptinline/true/) into the end-result.
\end{enumerate}

Hamsters.js automatically splits the input data into sub-arrays where each sub-array is processed by a single task. However, iterating over the elements of the sub-array is left to the task function (line \ref{code:hamsterjs-iterate}). The result of the task function has to be written into the \javascriptinline/rtn.data/ array (line \ref{code:hamsterjs-result}) that is provided by Hamsters.js. 

\begin{listing}
\begin{javascriptcode*}{highlightlines={5, 10-11, 15, 22, 26-34}}
const imageWidth = 10000;
const imageHeight = 10000;

function computeMandelbrotLine () {
	function computePixel(x, y) {|$\label{code:hamstersjs-compute-pixel}$|
		// ...
		return n;
	}

	const options = params.options; |$\label{code:hamstersjs-params}$|
	const input = params.array; |$\label{code:hamstersjs-params-two}$|

	const arraySize = options.imageWidth * 4;

	for (let i = 0; i < input.length; ++i) {|$\label{code:hamsterjs-iterate}$|
		const y = input[i];
		const line = new Uint8ClampedArray(arraySize);
		
		for (let x = 0; x < width; ++x) {
			line[x * 4] = computePixel(x, y);
		}
		rtn.data.push(line); |$\label{code:hamsterjs-result}$|
	}
}

hamsters.run( |$\label{code:hamsterjs-start}$|
	params: {
		array: _.range(options.imageHeight),
		options
	},  
	computeMandelbrotLine, 
	result => console.log(result), 
	hamsters.maxThreads, 
	true);
\end{javascriptcode*}
\caption{Mandelbrot Implementation using Hamsters.js}

\end{listing}

Hamsters.js \javascriptinline/run/ method is a mixture of a low- and high-level API. It allows to run a single function on a background thread but also exposes advanced features like work partitioning, result joining, and result caching. This overloading of the function makes it difficult to use because remembering the right order and semantics of the arguments is challenging. Such methods, which accept many arguments and expose multiple features, are considered as a code smell. Even though the \javascriptinline/run/ method offers many advanced features, still much manual work is needed to parallelize a problem like iterating over the input array elements. Like Threads.js, other functions defined in the same module can not be exposed to the task function requiring to nest the \javascriptinline/computePixel/ function (line \ref{code:hamstersjs-compute-pixel}) inside of the \javascriptinline/computeMandelbrotLine/ function restricting the programmer in its liberty to structure the code as he prefers and resulting in a clear break in the programming style. The API further has the disadvantage not to be type-safe because of the undeclared \javascriptinline/params/ (line \ref{code:hamstersjs-params}) and \javascriptinline/rtn/ (line \ref{code:hamsterjs-result}) variables in the task function. These variables also hinder code reuse because they are undeclared if the function is not invoked as a task function.

To sum up. Alike Parallel.js and Threads.js does Hamsters.js not provide a type-safe API. A more significant limitation is that functions from external modules can not be used inside of background tasks. It is, therefore not possible to use any libraries in background tasks. 

\subsection{Performance Comparison}
The benchmark results from \cref{fig:runtime-performance} show the absolute time needed by each implementation and a percentage indicating the fraction of the sequential runtime. The test setup uses a Windows 10 computer with a 4-Core, 2.5 GHz Xeon E5-2609v2 processor. The benchmark has been performed on all major browsers. Some of the results differ significantly from one another dependent upon the used browser. These discrepancies are caused by the browser specific JIT-optimizations. Microsoft Edge shows the most notable discrepancies since the performance of parallel computations drops significantly if the runtime system uses \javascriptinline/new Function/ or \javascriptinline/eval/ to create dynamic function instances --- which is the case for Hamsters.js and Threads.js. This observation has been reported and is confirmed by Microsoft~\cite{newFunctionWebWorkerEdge}. The following section describes the benchmark results measured using Firefox v.50. These results are used because they do not contain outliers caused by the browser's JIT-Optimizations as it is the case for other browsers.

\begin{figure*}
	\input{Firefox-50.0}	
	\caption{Runtime Performance of Parallelization Problems Relative to Sequential Execution}
	\label{fig:runtime-performance}
\end{figure*}


\paragraph{Knight Tour} The time needed to solve the Knight Tour problem is mainly determined by the available computational resources. The calculation is parallelized by computing different start-field sequences in each task and summarizing the number of found tours at the end. 

Parallel.js creates new tasks for accumulating the sub-results of start-field sequences computed by two tasks and executes them on designated background threads. This spawning of new background threads for accumulating the sub-results cause a significant overhead for the smaller $5\times5$ board. However, the impact is no longer visible for the larger board.

The results of Firefox do not indicate any advantage of using a thread pool over spawning new background threads for every task. It seems that creating background threads in Firefox is very inexpensive. However, the benchmarking results of Google Chrome v. 54 shown in \cref{fig:runtime-performance-chrome} give evidence that a thread pool might be advantageous for very short running tasks. Thus, Hamsters.js and Parallel.es achieve slightly better results than Parallel.js, which is not using a thread pool at all, and Threads.js, where each benchmark run creates a new thread pool\footnote{A new thread pool for each run is not strictly necessary for the Knight Tour problem. However, it is needed to store the simulation result of the risk profiling problem.}. 

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\input{knight-tour-5x5Chrome-54.0.2840.99}
	\caption{Knight Tour 5x5 Runtime Performance using Chrome}
	\label{fig:runtime-performance-chrome}
\end{figure}

The test case of the $6\times6$ Knight Tour only shows significant differences for the Hamsters.js runtime system. This difference is rooted in the strategy used to split the start-field sequences into tasks. Hamsters.js splits the start-field sequences evenly onto the available background threads\footnote{The number of background threads used by Hamsters.js is manually set to the number of logical processors offered by the hardware because it does not determine the optimal number of background threads automatically.}. However, some start-field sequences require more time to compute than others, resulting in unused computation resources when other tasks complete early. Parallel.js and Threads.js always use a task size of one to avoid this misfortune situation. Parallel.es also uses an even work splitting strategy but creates four-times as many tasks as background threads are available to balance the workload in case of nonlinear problems better. This strategy has shown to be a beneficial balance between having a large enough set of items to process by each task, to reduce the overhead for starting the tasks, while still leaving room to compensate for nonlinear problems. 

\paragraph{Mandelbrot}
The Mandelbrot problem is parallelized by computing a subset of the lines per task. The runtime of computing a single line depends upon the position of the line in the image --- it is a nonlinear problem. This nonlinearity is the reason why the Hamsters.js based implementation takes significantly longer. Its even distribution of the work onto the background threads results in tasks computing the center of the Mandelbrot taking longer than the ones at the top or bottom of the field. 

The better performance of Threads.js is rooted insofar that Threads.js supports transferables~\cite[Section 2.7.4]{w3cHtml5}. Transferables allow moving a memory range between threads instead of copying it. Hamsters.js also support transferables, however, only if the input and output are transferable objects what is not the case for the Mandelbrot implementation.

\paragraph{Risk Profiling}
The risk profiling implementation uses sim.js~\cite{simjs} as random number generator in the Monte Carlo simulation. Sim.js is used because the random generator can be initialized with a seed number what is needed to achieve reproducible forecasts. Hamsters.js is not part of this evaluation since it lacks support for importing functions from other modules and can therefore not use the sim.js library. 

The problem is parallelized by computing the outcome for a subset of investments in each task. However, this requires that each background thread run the Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the outcome of the planned investment. The overhead of computing the Monte Carlo simulation in each background thread is the reason why the achieved speedup is smaller than for the other problem instances.

Parallel.es requires more time for the computation because of its work splitting strategy used that distributes the investments evenly onto the background threads. However, computing the result of an investment is nonlinear; It depends on the year in which the investment takes place, the later, the more values have to be computed. This nonlinear computation time results in some tasks completing earlier than others leaving computation resources unused. Enforcing a smaller task-size is not a solution for this problem as it leads to recomputing the Monte Carlo simulation for each investment reducing the performance even more. Parallel.js and Threads.js can only use a task-size of one as the thread pool is not reused and therefore, the global context of the background thread can be used to store the simulation outcome. Manipulating the global context is not desired if shared background threads from a thread pool are used as it creates potential memory leaks.

\paragraph{Recursive Tasks} 
None of the evaluated libraries allow modeling recursive problems like the Knight-Tour or Quicksort naturally. Recursive problems have the characteristic that the input data for the subproblems is computed in the same step as the problem is solved. The backtracking based Knight Tour algorithm starts with a field and creates branches for every possible move by recursively descending for each distinct subpath allowing to parallelize the problem by computing each path in a separate task. This strategy requires a runtime system allowing to start subtasks from inside a task. These created subtasks can then be executed on any background thread to achieve a better work balance. The current implementation does not support this scenario and therefore, a limited set of start-field sequences are precomputed in the main-thread and started as separate tasks. However, each task computes the number of tours sequentially without further dividing into subtasks.


An efficient implementation to support recursive tasks requires a communication channel between all web workers to allow to start a subtask on another, idle background thread without an additional roundtrip over the main thread. However, web workers only have a single communication channel between the thread that has started the web worker and the spawned web worker. Shared Web Workers~\cite[section 4.6.4]{w3cWebWorker} allow a worker to have multiple channels between various workers but are not even supported by the latest versions of all major browsers. Furthermore, the \enquote{run to completion} model of JavaScript can be problematic because a busy background thread does not process received messages until the current work has completed. Therefore, the background thread does not respond to received messages in a guaranteed timeframe.

Further research is required to determine how recursive tasks can be supported in an environment without shared memory and the \enquote{run to completion} model.

\subsection{Summary of Evaluation Results}
The evaluation of the performance shows that the result is mainly determined by the used work splitting strategy. Surprisingly, the overhead needed to run a task on a background thread is almost negligible. Therefore, a task size of one ---- as used by Parallel.js and Threads.js --- seems generally to be a better choice than processing too many elements in a single task. The latter is preliminary problematic if the problem itself is nonlinear in which case a smaller task size helps to balance the workload. The evenly splitting of the work across the available number of background threads is the cause why Hamsters.js performs significantly worse than the other runtime systems for nonlinear problems. Parallel.es's approach of creating four times as many tasks as the hardware provides logical processors showed to be a good choice. 

The evaluated systems differ more significantly in their APIs. Some of the evaluated systems only offer a low-level API while other provide a high-level API as well. If one or the other is to be preferred is very subjective and principally dependent on the specific problem and the programmer's preferences. However, other properties are more objective: Hamsters.js impedes code reuse and is unsuitable if the task function depends upon libraries since it does not permit to expose additional functions, e.g. functions imported from libraries, to task functions. Parallel.es is the only valid option for projects using typed languages because it is the only with a type-safe API. Threads.js supports transferables hat allow to move the result of a computation instead of copying it. This moving between threads results in better runtime performances for computations over large amounts of data like the Mandelbrot problem.


All the runtime systems have in common that they specify restrictions for task functions affecting the structuring of the code. This lack of freedom creates a clearly visible seam between background tasks and the rest of the application. Parallel.es reduces this seam to a minimum by transpiling the program code prior to execution allowing a far more complete set of JavaScript functions to be used as task functions.
